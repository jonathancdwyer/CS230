- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room was a client that wanted a web-based version of their game to expand their current market. The overall goal was to create a cross-platform version of the game that could support more users, persist game sessions, and ensure the data held by the game was secure.
  
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - One thing that I feel I did well by the end of the course was define the system architecture. I was able to explain how the serverless design would support scalability while maintaining security and performance. 
  
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  - The design document definitely helped me understand the whole picture with the game so that when developing, I could stay focused on what was really needed. It also helped with the structure of the code as well.
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - I would improve the evaluations. While I improved it over time by the end, I feel like I should have spent far more time on that area to determine, more clearly, the differences between the environments.
  
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - I interpereted the users needs by focusing on accessability, responsiveness, and ease of use. It is critical to consider the users needs because at the end of the day, even if you design an amazing product, if it is not what they wanted, then user adoption will be low.
  
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  - My approach centered around modularity and scalability. The main goal of The Gaming Room when developing this, was that they wanted to scale to a much larger audience. Modularity and scalability needed to be the focus to ensure that when users increase, the structure was there to support. In the future, I will definitely continue to use UML modeling, AGILE planning, and iterative prototyping to refine my designs early on versus having a major overhaul later in the process.
